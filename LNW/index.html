				Future lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made headlines this November when she
				announced that she will not be able to afford rent in Washington, DC, 
				until she assumes office in January. With a net worth around $7,000, per 
				CNBC, Ocasio-Cortez is almost 160 times less wealthy than the median
				wealth of a US Congress member, according to 2014 data from the Center for 
				Responsive Politics.
				<br><br>
				The knowledge that US Congress members are exceedingly wealthy is unsurprising, 
				but the depth and extent of their wealth is astonishing. The median net worth 
				of Congress members was $831k more in 2013 than the median net worth of college-educated 
				Americans and $969k more than the median net worth of all Americans.
				<br><br>
				When looking at average net worth, this gap increases dramatically. Buoyed by 
				the incredible wealth of multi-millionaires like Darrell Issa (R, CA) and Jared 
				Polis (D, CO), both of whom are worth more than $375M, the average net worth of
				US Congress members in 2013 outpaces even the top decile of US households and by 
				$352k.
				<br><br>
				The chart to the left shows this trend, plotting the median and average net worth
				of US lawmakers, estimated by the Center for Responsive Politics from 2004 to 2013,
				against US Census data for the net worth of all Americans and those 
				who are college-educated or in the top decile of wealth. Notably, the net worth of 
				every subset of the US population decreases after 2007, largely due to the housing 
				collapse and ensuing financial crisis. 
				<br><br>
				Along party lines, a split also exists between the median net worth of Republicans 
				and Democrats, with Republicans holding a gap of roughly $300k from 2004 to 2008. 
				After 2009, this gap has largely closed with the median net worth of Democrats 
				rising to meet the median net worth of Republicans. When considering average net worth, 
				this gap flips, with the average net worth of
				Democratic Congress members dominating Republican Congress members for all but 
				two years from 2004 to 2014.
				<br><br>
				The interactive chart below highlights the outliers in Congress, mapping the area of each 
				bubble to the net worth of the lawmaker. While many members of Congress are multi-millionaires, 
				several members are also in debt (their net worth is represented by a black bubble). Notably, 
				David Valadao, a California Representative and Dairy Farmer, has a net worth of roughly $25M, due to 
				lines of credit for his farm.
